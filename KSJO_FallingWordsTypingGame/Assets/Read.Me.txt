Innovation Project - APIs in Unity

Project Description - While using the tutorial produced by Brackeys (Falling Words Typing Game) as a base for the project, I implemented two scripts and modified the code scripts of Brackeys' project to produce my desired effects. First, I implemented an Image Search API that would find, download, and display images of the words that were typed by the player, this would occur with each word typed. Second, I implemented a Random Word API that would produce more words for the game so things wouldn't get stale.

The game is currently not in a completed state - The game works in the way that I want it to, but there is no Main Menu, Pause Menu, Game Over function, Game Over Menu, Score function, etc.

The scrips within the folder "Brackeys" are all the scripts from Brackeys' GitHub -
